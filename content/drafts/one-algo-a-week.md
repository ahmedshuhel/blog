# Project: One Algorithm a Week

This is a project that I am strting officially from today with some larger goals in mind. After an year I want to see myself knowing and implementing at least 365 algorithms in different languages like C#, JAVA, JavaScript etc.

I will have to come up with a list of algorithms first but I don't have to figure out the entire list at once right at this very moment; I can be "Agile" and just put the first one I want to takle now.

This post will serve as the index of the journey. As I tackle one I will have a post about it and will update this post with the link.

Now, let's just find the next algorithm to learn and implement. In the past, I am sure; I have come across some `awesome-alogorithms` type listing in github and stared them. Let's start with that.


This is the list I gonna cover first
