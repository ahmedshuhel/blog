In software industry the name of the game is understanding the `true` requirements. Becasue of the way we have been raised as a human being, we often do not know what we want. We have an idea of what we want but we don't clearly know that.

We can observe this behaviour when shopping. We keep looking for the right thing and try to convince the seller by giving examples of what cloth we want. 

For a software perspective this is tricky especially because it's the most logical thing. Most software developer has no or little sense of business requirements. They have little skills about organizational politics etc. 

A large system that is used by different level of people tend to have different conflicting agendas. To make a project suceessfully implemented and see it's being used by all these people needs a special kind of skills apart from being a great technical problem solver. Developing a software with the latest and greatest technology is half the stroy often. If you don't understand the `true` requirements, everything you develop will be a west. 

Often times users don't care about the tecnology that is buzzing around. A user is only setisfied if and only if the software does what he wants. For him great look and even usability is secendary if that's not what the user actually asked for. A user will first see if he/she gets what she asks for. It does not matter if you tell him that we have all these bunch of features that you can use.

All the features are worthless if the user does not use it.

Going back to the original point, understanding the requirement and implementing them in a way that all the group of users are satisfied will only make a project successfull. 

This is tricky, not everbody have that skill. Some have that. And their projects is successfull. Rest of us feels the heat.
