Often times I feel like writing is harder than writing code. This is mainly becasue of the confusing I have. Before writing code I know exactly what I want. So my every keystroke is geaared toward achiving that resual. Of course I keep readability in mind. I don't consider a code base well if it does not reads well. 

For a general wiring however, I don't know what I want untill I finished it. This creates the problem. Friction in my mind. 

## Lot of concentration goes to the formatting of the writing.
Again content should be the king not the formatting but I does have a profound impact on the quality of writing. Too much focus on the formatting can kill the flow of the content.

## Structure/Organization of the articale
Again, to convey the idea properly to the reades is a praimary goal. Order of the thoughts, what part should follow what helps the reder understand the concept.

## My mind does not work that way.

Thoughts come randomly, not in an orderd/syncronous way. When finised it may look beautiful.

Bits and pieces does not come to me as I want them to.

## What should I do
I learnt a mantra from great @adyosmani, "do it, do it right, do it better" . I write the thoughts as they come to my mind. I should not think about how they come. Just write them as they come. 

When you don't have anything comming refactor. While refactoring if something comes. Jot down at the end or write in place. refactor. 

## What is refactoring

Refactoring is ordering the thoughts from the readers perspective. Adding supporting lines to support the ideas. Adding examples. etc. Most importantly not formatting, e.g. bold, italic, underline, coloer etc.

## Formatting is the last thing you should do.
