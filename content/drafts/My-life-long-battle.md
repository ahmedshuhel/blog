Even as I write this piece, I am lost. Collecting thoughts and develiver them coherently to the other people is a task weight the world to me. It's so complex of a process to be spontnious. When I see other people doing it effertlessly, I become amaized. 


The problem
I feel blocked inside. My mind gets cluttered instantly and all of a sudden my brain is empty as if I never had anything to say, didn't learn or experience anything life. Eventyally loose the confidence and start mumbling.
