I am reading this Extreme Ownership book written by two Navy Seal. In the first chapter they talk about ownership and how to take it. In case of failure a leader must take all the responsibility without giving excuses. No matter who in the team is at fault ultimate responsibility lies in the shoulder of the leader of the team.

It will start a ripple effect.


A team needs to fail in order to bond as a team and gain trust on eachother.
