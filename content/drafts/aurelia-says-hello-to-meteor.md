# Aurelia Meteor

##
Most important thing about writing a SPA app in Meteor Platform is to understand how meteor loads assets like html and js. We need a different extension and tell meteor to treat thse extensions differently so we went with `.es.js` and `.tmpl.html`. The rest is upto babel and aurelia bundler.

## Context

Meteor treats `html` and `js` like it has the only right to have them, no one else can even play with them. But it of course let of it through plugins.
