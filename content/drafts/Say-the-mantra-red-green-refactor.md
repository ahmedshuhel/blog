Every morning before I start coding or anytime I start coding I need to remaid the matra to myself. It's a simple thing but makes a huge difference in my coding life. I stay focus more when I do as a result I get more things done and that ultimately keeps my stress level normal.

I am a test first kind of a person. Writing a test before writing the actual code helps me set my priorities and expections right off the bet. This eventually keeps me focused all day. Since I push refactor at the end, it helps me not doing over engineering. It helps me switch off that part of the brain altogether. When I think about what is the best way to structre the code I loose focus on writing the code and the solution of the problem at hand. Once I get the test passing. I then refactor, make to pretty extract functions, rename variables, do whatever it takes to make the whole thing more readable and maintailable.


Nice thing about this approch is applicable almost everywhere in a creative life. This is to me other way of saying what I learned from Addy Osmani "First do it, then do it right, then do it better". It's all about iteration. Incremental changes and makeing it better with each change.

Writing the test first to me is setting the expectation and success criteria. It's a fun game from that point on.
