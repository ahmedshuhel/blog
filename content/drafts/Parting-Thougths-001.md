Not sure if I can call it a "good productive" day. I have mixed feelings about it. Most of the day went according to plan. I successfully collected the passport I was aiming for. That was the primary objective of the day. I thought I will be able to come back home by 14:00 but the queue surprised me at the passport office. It took me about 3 hours to get to the end of the line and submit the collection slip. They took another hour to finally deliver the passport. By the time I reached home it's 16:00. Standing up in the line under the angry sun was excruciating; I hardly had any bit of energy left after that.

I replied a few emails and answered some slack message but most importantly I made a plan for tomorrow.
