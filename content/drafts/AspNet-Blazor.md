Watched a Steve Sanderson conference talk on Youtube last night. He is one of the best hackers I have ever known. I have never seen anybody does live coding in front of thousands of people so confidently ever.

The talk was on whats possible in the new web where technologies like Service Worker, Web Assembly etc. are maturing. He demonstrated an experimental framework he built that basically allows developer to build single page web app using  C# and Razor view engine. Now it's not a compile to javascript type of thing. He made a dotnet runtime and framework available in the browser via web assembly and the app can use almost all the dotnet. The name of project is [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor).

It got me excited. Next few days, I will be tinkering with this project.
