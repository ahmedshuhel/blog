# Multi Bundle Support for Aurelia CLI

So far what we have seen the in post or peaple are trying only the single bundle for js to templates.

There are some people asking for mulit bundle support for different stage. For example we would love to have just the `core framework` bundle during development and in production everything. So how can we achive such thing?

Well we have multi bundle support from the beginning but was un noticed.
