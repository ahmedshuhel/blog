Last few days, I am thinking about philosophy a lot. It seems to me that everyone needs to have a philosophy but very few people actually consciously think about the philosophy they have or adopted. I have been watching the debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris entire last week. Eye opening in many cases. Jordan is a very intelligent man. I am familiar with Sam's work and philosophy. He is one of the best in this area. But I could never imagine someone could actually make a case in favor of religion and it's utility in 20st century. Jordan did exactly that. I wouldn't say he managed to change my view on religion but boy 'o boy what a hack of an argument he made there. Anyway, there's a lot that I have to study and I will be doing that in the coming days.

Today, I have been thinking about how my stress might be related to the chaotic way I learn things and navigate life. Nothing is predictable per say in my case even to me. What this means is end of a day I am not satisfied. I don't feel like I have accomplished anything. I don't have any meaningful conclusion of the day. And over a month or year all these adds up and creates a massive amount of pressure in me. Even though I am constantly learning new things or doing stuff.

Again, one the Jordan's lecture got me thinking all these he was talking about the usefulness of having a schedule for the day/month. It's about how efficiently you can do your work. He was also arguing about the importance of writing. He thinks writing is thinking. And, I can't agree more. For me that's the only way I can bring some order in my crazy thought trains.

Here's the take away for the day:

1) The first thing I am gonna do tomorrow in the morning is planning the day.
2) Will try to stick to the plan as much as possible.
3) Write about the day.
